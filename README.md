# Tablet's mod XD

## My first java project and minecraft mod (update of a mod from ages ago, with a few additions). 

### Get Netherite Horse Armor > Put armor on horse > Ride horse (to save horse for later use)
### Sneak or press keybind to unsummon mount.
### Press keybind to resummon.


changes in mechanics (while wearing netherite horse armor)

<sub>No block break speed penalty while on horseback

Horse wont wander while saddled

Horse wont randomly buck, causing a random stop

Click through your mount with any tool/weapon

Horse can now Double-jump

Horse can now swim and ride in rafts

_jeb nametag can be added to a horse, for colorful effects</sub>
